Overview
========

GtkVlcPlayer is an extremely easy to use GTK+ 2.0 widget that
wraps [libVLC](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/libvlc.html).
In other words it allows you to easily embed the
[VLC player](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/) into a GTK+ project.

There is a sample program in `examples/simple.c`.
It is built with `make check`.

GtkVlcPlayer was originally developed as part of a larger
project for the Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg.

Features
========

* Simple API (perhaps too simple)
* Automatically supports fullscreen playback by double-clicking
  the GtkVlcPlayer widget
* Supports synchronization with sliders and volume widgets via
  GtkAdjustments
* Comes with a [Glade 3](https://glade.gnome.org/) catalog file
  so you can easily use it in Glade UIs.
* Runs on Windows (compile with MinGW)
* Supports a wide range libVLC versions beginning with v1.1.10
